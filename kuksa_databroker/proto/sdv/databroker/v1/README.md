# sdv.databroker.v1 protobuf API

This directory contain a Protobuf API supported by KUKSA.val Databroker.

As of today KUKSA.val Databroker supports both this API and the
[kuksa.val.v1](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/tree/master/proto/kuksa/val/v1) API.
The [kuksa.val.v1](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/tree/master/proto/kuksa/val/v1) API is the newer API and is still
in development. It does not yet support all features supported by this API.

This API may in the future be deprecated. It is recommended to use
the [kuksa.val.v1](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/tree/master/proto/kuksa/val/v1) API, unless you need
functionality currently only provided by this API.
