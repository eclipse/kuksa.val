# What do the KUKSA.val Server and databroker support?
This file contains an overview what the KUKSA.val Server and databroker each supports. It focuses on gRPC and VISS support and also what feeders are supported.

## Supported protocols


| Protocol   |      KUKSA.val server      |  KUKSA.val databroker   |
|------------|:-----------------:|----------:|
| VISS V1    |      o           |     o     |
| VISS V2    |     x/o          |     o     |
| gRPC       |      x           |     x     |

x = supported; x/o = partly supported; o = not supported


### Server and VISS 

KUKSA.val server supports the semantic of [VISS v1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vehicle-information-service/) using the new syntax of [VISS v2](https://www.w3.org/TR/viss2-core/).

KUKSA.val only supports the Websocket transport defined in VISS v2.

Support of VISSv2:

### Security model
KUKSA.val does not support the VISS V2 security model and currently we are not planning to support. KUKSA.val server does support authenticated access to VSS resources. For details check [here.](../KUKSA.val_server/jwt.md).

### Supported VISS (v2) calls

### KUKSA.val databroker gRPC API
The VISS Standard is not applicable for gRPC protocol. Here is an overview what the gRPC API in KUKSA.val databroker is capable of:

  * Read: Reading VSS datapoints 
    * Reading current or target value for actuators
    * Reading some metadata information from VSS datapoints
  * Write: Writing VSS datapoints
    * Writing sensor values
    * Writing current or target value for actuators
    * Soon: Writing some metadata information from VSS datapoints
  * Subscription: Subscribing VSS datapoints
    * Subscribing sensor values
    * Subscribing current or target value for actuators
